The Python script provided is a simple yet effective port scanner,
utilizing the socket module for low-level network communication. 
It begins by importing the necessary socket module, which provides
access to network interfaces. The core functionality is encapsulated
within the PS function, which takes three parameters: the target
host's IP address or hostname, the starting port number for the
scan, and the ending port number. Inside this function, a start
message is printed to indicate the initiation of the port scan,
followed by an attempt to resolve the hostname to its corresponding
IP address. If the hostname resolution fails, an error message is
printed, and the function exits.

Next, a loop iterates through each port in the specified range,
creating a TCP socket for each port using socket.socket() and
setting a timeout of 2 seconds for the connection attempt. 
The connect_ex() method is then used to attempt a connection to the
target host and port. If the connection attempt is successful
(indicated by a return value of 0), the port is considered open,
and a corresponding message is printed. Otherwise, 
if the connection attempt fails, the port is considered closed, 
and a message indicating the same is printed.

The function handles potential exceptions gracefully,
including keyboard interrupts (KeyboardInterrupt) 
and socket errors (socket.error). If a keyboard interrupt is
detected (typically triggered by pressing Ctrl+C), 
an exit message is printed, and the function exits. Similarly, if a
socket error occurs during the connection attempt, 
an error message is printed, and the function exits.

Additionally, a main function is defined as the entry point of 
the script, which prompts the user to input the target
host's IP address or hostname, as well as the range 
of ports to scan. Finally, the main function calls 
the PS function with the user-provided input parameters 
to initiate the port scan.

In summary, this Python script serves as a basic yet functional 
port scanner, allowing users to scan a range of ports 
on a specified target host. It employs low-level 
ocket programming to establish connections and provides 
robust error handling to ensure a smooth scanning process.
