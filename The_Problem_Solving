The Problem You Are Solving:

The problem being addressed by the project is the need for a
reliable and efficient method to scan ports on a target host. 
Port scanning is a fundamental technique used in cybersecurity 
to identify open ports that might be potential entry points 
for unauthorized access or vulnerabilities. Manual port scanning 
can be time-consuming and tedious, especially when dealing 
with a large number of ports or multiple target hosts. 
Therefore, automating the port scanning process with a script 
like the one provided can greatly enhance efficiency and 
accuracy in network reconnaissance tasks.
