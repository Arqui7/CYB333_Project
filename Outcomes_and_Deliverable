The primary deliverable of the project is a functional port scanning
tool implemented in Python. This tool should be capable of 
scanning a specified range of ports on a target host 
and reporting which ports are open and which are closed.

The port scanner should include robust error handling mechanisms 
to gracefully handle potential exceptions, such as 
hostname resolution errors, connection timeouts, 
and socket errors. This ensures that the tool remains 
reliable and stable during operation.
